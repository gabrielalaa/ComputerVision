# Computer Vision

My purpose was to dive deeper into this topic and analyze existing solutions.

I aimed to investigate the challenges in handling edge cases and explored the impact of dataset diversity on model 
performance. 

I combined both quantitative and qualitative approaches: 
- Quantitative: I analyzed datasets, applied statistics, and used computational methods to study specific phenomena
- Qualitative: I conducted a literature review to evaluate existing solutions and analyzed trends in computer vision applications

Everythins was done under the guidance of Dipl.-Ing. Dr. techn. Sarita Paudel at IMC University of Applied Sciences Krems.
